# Computational-Economics-II
Second semester computational Ecnomics course

The focus of this course is to teach students the techniques for using dynamic programming to model and solve economic problems. We will cover markov chains stochastic processes and other dynamic programming techniques. We will also cover the seminal study and work to improve student computational skill.
